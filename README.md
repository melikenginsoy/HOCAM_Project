# A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL TO SUPPORT THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR 8th GRADE STUDENTS 

# Business Problem

The high number of students causes the student course status follow-up to take a long time.
Questions such as the causes of student failures and whether the source of incorrect answers
is student-centered or classroom-based is a complex area. In this project, it is aimed to try
to support teachers' student course status tracking through machine learning algorithms.
